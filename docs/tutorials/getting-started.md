# Getting Started with Sunny Acres Farm Repository

**Tutorial Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Level:** Beginner  
**Prerequisites:** GitHub account

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

1. Navigate the farm repository
2. Find information about crops, livestock, equipment, and compliance
3. Create your first issue to report or request something
4. Understand the basic workflow

## Step 1: Understanding the Repository Structure

The Sunny Acres repository is organized like a filing cabinet with four main drawers:

````markdown
github4farms-training/
├── crops/           # Everything about what we grow
├── livestock/       # Everything about our animals
├── equipment/       # Everything about our machinery
└── compliance/      # Everything about regulations and grants
````

**Try it yourself:**

1. Go to the [repository homepage](https://github.com/zircote/github4farms-training)
2. Click on the **crops/** folder
3. You'll see several markdown (.md) files — these are farm records

## Step 2: Reading a Farm Record

Let's look at a planting schedule:

1. From the **crops/** folder, click on **planting-schedule.md**
2. You'll see a table showing when different crops are planted in different fields

**What you're seeing:**
- Field names (e.g., "North 40", "South Field")
- Crop types (corn, soybeans, wheat)
- Planting dates

This is how all farm data is stored — in simple, readable text files.

## Step 3: Finding Specific Information

Let's say you need to know when the tractor was last serviced:

1. Click the repository name at the top to go back to the main page
2. Click on **equipment/**
3. Click on **maintenance-log.md**
4. Scan the table for "John Deere 6120M Tractor"

**Pro tip:** Use your browser's search function (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) to quickly find specific equipment or dates.

## Step 4: Creating Your First Issue

Issues are how we track tasks, report problems, or ask questions. Let's create one:

1. Go to the **Issues** tab (near the top of the page)
2. Click the green **New issue** button
3. Choose a template:
   - **Crop Issue Report** — for planting, harvesting, or crop problems
   - **Equipment Maintenance** — for equipment repairs or service
   - **Livestock Health Record** — for animal health concerns

4. Let's choose **Equipment Maintenance**
5. Fill in the form:
   - **Title:** "Oil change for John Deere 6120M"
   - **Equipment:** John Deere 6120M Tractor
   - **Issue Type:** Routine Maintenance
   - **Description:** "Tractor is due for 500-hour oil change"

6. Click **Submit new issue**

**Congratulations!** You just created your first farm record issue.

## Step 5: Understanding Labels

Your issue automatically got some labels (colored tags):

- **equipment** — Shows this is about machinery
- **maintenance** — Shows it's a maintenance task
- **routine** — Shows the priority level

Labels help organize and filter issues. You can click any label to see all similar issues.

## Step 6: Exploring Other Sections

Now explore the other sections on your own:

- **livestock/** → Find the feeding schedule
- **compliance/** → See what grants are active
- **README.md** (root) → Quick overview of everything
